# Dunes GUI EXE

## Overview

The Dunes GUI is a simplified interface for managing Dunes Protocol operations conveniently through a graphical user interface (GUI).
With this application, users can generate wallets, sync wallets, send funds, deploy Dunes, mint Dunes, print balances, and perform various other Dunes-related tasks, with no coding experience.
Just need a Active Node and some Dogecoin!

## Features

Generate and sync wallets

Send and receive funds

Deploy and mint Dunes

Print Dune balances

Simplified interface for easy navigation

## Requirements

Create Working Directory: The GUI exe should be saved in a file path you Create:
 
`C:\Dunes-GUI`

Along with blank `.wallet.json` file and a copy of the Dunes acceptable  `.env` file that should be all you need.

If you already have dunes and doginals client set up, and and are in filepath named `C:\ Doginals-main\Dunes-main` it will recognize current wallet info particularly in that path and it adds your current dunes minting wallet info from your `.wallet.json`, this is for people already minting both. For everyone not set up and just running a node and wallet funded with doge you can add your `.wallet.json` key and address in the GUI, and a created directory.

Active Dunes Node: Before using the Dunes GUI, ensure that you have an active Dunes node running on your system. 
The GUI interacts with the Dunes Protocol through this node.

**Dogecoin**: The Dunes Protocol is built on top of Dogecoin, so make sure you have a basic understanding of Dogecoin and its functionalities.

*Note: It does make commands through operating system dealing with the node.js and dunes and doginals scripts. Because of that dependency it flags microsoft defender, so I noticed when I dowloaded file from Github, it got flagged so I had to adjust the windows defender bypass setting to let it through.*

# Button Functions:

***Details:***

**Click File button to set `.env` file for fees, you can change every setting but its recommended to leave the env file as follows:**

PROTOCOL_IDENTIFIER=D

NODE_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:22555

NODE_RPC_USER=rpc_user

-Existing Wallet: If you have been followiing me and already have file paths based on our repos for C:\Doginals-main\Dunes-main it will scan for this wallet.json in this directory first, if you have that file it will copy it to C:\Dunes-GUI then it syncs. 
If you dont have this path already it scans GUI path to see if you have a exsisting wallet inside the exe since the time you used it last then syncs. 
If no wallet it prompts you to create a new one in which you have to record the Private Key and Address manually, or enter private key, in which you can enter the private key you just created or already have to use.
